Continue reading to learn why you should download this app today!\n\n-----------------------\n\n■ Featured by Apple in \"App Store Essentials: Camera & Photography\" and \"Extraordinary Photo Apps\"\n\n■ Nominated for the 2010 and 2011 \"Best App Ever Award - Best Photo App\"\n\n■ Recently mentioned by the NY Times\n\n-----------------------\n\n\"It’s one of those rare photography apps that creates effects that few others are capable of, and it does it easily and with better results.\"\n— Marty Yawnick, Life In LoFi\n\n-----------------------\n\nHow many times have you tried to capture artful images with your iPhone camera but were left wishing you had more features to work with? Slow Shutter Cam puts an end to mere snapshots and gives you some of the most powerful features of a DSLR camera. All this, in a package that fits in your pocket.\n \nSlow Shutter Cam offers three capture modes to capture unique images:\n \nMOTION BLUR: Equivalent to the shutter priority mode on a DSLR, the Motion Blur mode is perfect for creating ghost images, waterfall effects or suggesting movement in your photographs by adding a blur.\n\nLOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nLIGHT TRAIL: The Light Trail mode allows you to 'paint' with light, show car light trails and fireworks or capture any other moving light in a unique way. Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!\n\nHighlights:\n\n● Full resolution (on every devices)\n● Real time live preview\n● Innovative 'Freeze' control\n● Exposure compensation\n● Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n● Exposure lock (from shot to shot)\n● Handy Self-Timer\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go. Download it now and put an end to mere snapshots!\n\nSearch #slowshuttercam on Instagram or visit the \"iPhone - Slow Shutter Cam\" group on flickr for amazing samples!"

Talk with friends right in the battle!\n• Challenging and exciting experience that can really get you hooked! \n\n*** COOPERATIVE MODE *** \nCooperative mode features: \n• Up to 4 Players in one game. \n• Chat is available as well!\n•  8 special maps.\n• Hardcore gameplay. \n• Coins as a prize for top results. \n\n\n*** SURVIVAL CAMPAIGN *** \nIn this mode your character is “face to face” with hordes of zombies attacking you from all sides. You have to wipe them out otherwise you are doomed! \nYour only task is not an easy one - to whack all the monsters. If you survive all the attacks of the dead, you'll face an EVIL ZOMBIE BOSS. Having made mincemeat of him, you open the portal to the next battlefields! \n\nNew cool features in a campaign mode: \n• A new training camp for first-timers. \n• More detailed graphics. \n• More challenging gameplay: now you are not able to pass through enemies.

Using this tool you can choose one of the presets or customize your own skin with the help of special drawing tools. Then you can upload a skin to your Mojang account and play Minecraft with fun on your computer (unfortunately, skins maker is available only for PC version of Minecraft, because the iPhone/iPad operating systems don’t support these functions). \n\nThank you for all the comments and advices, we really appreciate it. In this version we tried to fulfill your wishes. Wait for the next updates with new cool features! \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nThis is not an official Mojang app. Alex Krasnov is not associated or connected with Mojang AB.

With TurboScan, you can quickly scan your documents and store or email them as multipage PDF or JPEG files. \n\n#1 business app in the United States and 30+ other countries for 2 years!\n\n• \"Unbelievably sharp. The best app I’ve tried... The scan accuracy of SureScan mode is brilliant\"  (AppBank review, April 2010) \n• \"I’ve downloaded and purchased many fantastic apps, but Turboscan is the tool that has added the most value to my iPhone\" (iosLawyer.com, Dec 2012)\n• \"Produces not a photograph of a document, but a very clear copier quality image, Having this app is like having a portable copier in your pocket\"  (TurboScan user)\n\nTurboScan uses advanced fast algorithms to auto-detect document edges, straighten the documents (correct perspective), eliminate shadows and set a perfect contrast.\n\nTurboScan boasts a powerful yet easy to use interface. Get instant one-tap brightness, rotation and color controls all on one screen!\n\nTurboScan also offers SureScan, our proprietary scanning mode for sharper scans (especially useful in low-light conditions.) SureScan requires taking three pictures of the same document with the iPhone camera. \n\nTurboScan's handy \"Email to myself\" feature lets you send documents to a predefined address, or even upload them to online storage sites like Evernote, with a single tap. \n\nAll processing happens on your iPhone, and the confidentiality of your data is never compromised (no Internet connection needed.)\n\nTURBOSCAN FEATURES: \n• Automatic document edge detection and perspective correction \n• Ultra-fast processing (under 4 seconds per page) \n• SureScan mode for very sharp scans \n• Document naming, storage inside the app and search\n• Multipage editing: add, reorder, and delete pages\n• Copy pages to Clipboard and Paste\n• “Email to myself” feature for quick emails \n• Email document as PDF, JPEG or PNG, or save to camera roll\n• Arrange multiple receipts or business cards on a PDF page\n• Open PDFs or JPEGs in other apps like the free Dropbox app (or Evernote, SkyDrive, GoogleDrive app, etc) to send to clouds, or fax apps \n• Printing via AirPrint \n• Instant one-tap brightness, rotation, and color controls \n• Compact attachments with adjustable size \n\n• Not recommended to use with iPod Touch 4 or iPad 2 camera (due to its low resolution). \n• Works great with the iPod Touch 5 and is compatible with the iPad 3 or newer.\n\nTIPS ON SCANNING \n• Make sure your document is flat and well lit. \n• Use flash in low light conditions, but avoid glare with glossy documents (magazines, etc.)\n\nWe're constantly improving TurboScan, and we value our customers' opinions and feedback. If you want to send us your feedback or have a problem with our software,  please contact us at  support@turboscanapp.com  before submitting a comment to the app store. Remember that we can solve most of the problems, but we cannot respond to comments."

Load a foreground image.\n3. Mask out unwanted portion of the foreground image using wide range of masking tools.\n4. Smoothen the edges with smoothen tool inside the app, if required.\n5. Move, Scale, Resize, Rotate, Flip the foreground to place it on the right location on the background image.\n6. Adjust the colors/exposure/contrast/hue/saturation etc. of the foreground and the background images if required to match both the images in terms of colors.\n7. You are done! Save it to the photo library at full resolution or share it on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nYou can also use this tool to do serious photo editing tasks like blending textures or overlaying borders or to do double exposure with adjustable transparency and 18 blending modes.\n\nMasking in the app is the most powerful one available on the app store, just tap on an area of the photo, and the app will mask out all the connected area with similar colors. Or you can use brush, lasso, global color similarity, rectangle, ellipse, linear, bi-linear or radial gradient masking tools. Mask a portion with this tool and that portion of the foreground image will become transparent and reveal the background.\n\nNOTE: The app saves at full camera resolution up to iPhone 4S, all 8 megapixels (even higher on iPad), just you need to enable high resolution save in the settings."

          "label": "Papa's Burgeria is now available to play on the go, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.  Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  \r\n\r\nYou're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!\r\n\r\nEach Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!\r\n\r\n**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nGRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you've cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!\r\n\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on burger shop game in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between grilling, stacking, and serving\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- Over 60 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- Over 50 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out the original \"Papa's Burgeria\" for iPad!"

While playing music, brad inspires the townsfolk to fight for him instead of hiding. \n\nThe moral of the game is doing what makes you happy instead of what’s expected of you, the irony is that brad could kill most of these enemies with one swing of his weapon, but chooses not to.\n\nDodge enemy projectiles while your followers attack for you.  Use power-solos for attack, defense and speed buffs.  Killing 5 enemies without being hit will give you a stun power-solo which knocks back and stuns your enemies, as well as destroying all enemy projectiles.\n\nFeatures:\n- Unique, hybrid, genre-bending gameplay\n- Hand-drawn original artwork.\n- 12 unlockable characters! Customize your party loadout, over 200 possible combinations.\n- Collect loot from your fallen enemies and upgrade Brad, the town, and your units in the shop!\n- 4 intense boss battles.\n- An awesome rock/metal soundtrack by Maximum Satan"
